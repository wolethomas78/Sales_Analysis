###  Chart Referenced: Power BI KPI Cards – Revenue & Profit (PYTD vs YTD) by Quarter

---

### Q1 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue increased from **$50K (PYTD)** to **$61K (YTD)**  
  - Profit rose from **$39K (PYTD)** to **$48K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  The business saw a strong start in Q1 2024 with a **22% increase in revenue** and **23% increase in profit** compared to the same period last year.

- **Impact:**  
  Indicates successful sales initiatives and effective performance early in the year.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Continue to reinforce successful Q1 strategies. Scale up the high-performing products, regions, or customer segments that contributed to this growth.

---

### Q2 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue declined slightly from **$111K (PYTD)** to **$107K (YTD)**  
  - Profit dropped from **$86K (PYTD)** to **$81K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  A minor dip in revenue (~3.6%) and profit (~5.8%) signals a potential softening of sales performance.

- **Impact:**  
  This decline interrupts the positive momentum from Q1 and may point to operational or market challenges.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Perform a detailed variance analysis to uncover the root causes. Reassess sales strategies, review product/channel performance, and consider cost containment initiatives.

---

### Q3 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue dropped from **$173K (PYTD)** to **$142K (YTD)**  
  - Profit decreased from **$133K (PYTD)** to **$107K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  A significant year-over-year drop of **~18% in revenue** and **~20% in profit** shows a downward trend continuing into Q3.

- **Impact:**  
  Ongoing decline suggests broader issues such as declining demand, pricing pressure, or strategic misalignment.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Conduct a comprehensive business review. Focus on stabilizing key segments, optimizing pricing and promotions, and re-aligning resources to high-performing areas identified in earlier quarters.

### Key Insight: Treadmill Revenue Trend (2024)

#### Chart Referenced  
Clustered Bar Chart – Top 10 Products by Revenue (Q1, Q2, Q3 2024)

---

#### Observation  
Treadmill leads the top 10 products with revenues of **$5.2K in Q1**, **$6.0K in Q2**, followed by a notable decline to **$3.58K in Q3**.

---

#### Interpretation  
Sales showed growth between Q1 and Q2 but dropped significantly in Q3, which may indicate seasonal demand fluctuations, supply chain challenges, or increased competition.

---

#### Impact  
This decline could negatively affect overall quarterly revenue and profitability, given Treadmill’s position as the highest-revenue product.

---

#### Recommendation  
Perform an in-depth analysis of Q3 sales drivers—review marketing campaigns, inventory management, and competitor activities. Implement targeted promotions or product bundling to boost Q3 sales and smooth revenue across the year.
