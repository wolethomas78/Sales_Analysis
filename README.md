###  Chart Referenced: Power BI KPI Cards – Revenue & Profit (PYTD vs YTD) by Quarter

---

### Q1 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue increased from **$50K (PYTD)** to **$61K (YTD)**  
  - Profit rose from **$39K (PYTD)** to **$48K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  The business saw a strong start in Q1 2024 with a **22% increase in revenue** and **23% increase in profit** compared to the same period last year.

- **Impact:**  
  Indicates successful sales initiatives and effective performance early in the year.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Continue to reinforce successful Q1 strategies. Scale up the high-performing products, regions, or customer segments that contributed to this growth.

---

### Q2 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue declined slightly from **$111K (PYTD)** to **$107K (YTD)**  
  - Profit dropped from **$86K (PYTD)** to **$81K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  A minor dip in revenue (~3.6%) and profit (~5.8%) signals a potential softening of sales performance.

- **Impact:**  
  This decline interrupts the positive momentum from Q1 and may point to operational or market challenges.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Perform a detailed variance analysis to uncover the root causes. Reassess sales strategies, review product/channel performance, and consider cost containment initiatives.

---

### Q3 2024

- **Observation:**  
  - Revenue dropped from **$173K (PYTD)** to **$142K (YTD)**  
  - Profit decreased from **$133K (PYTD)** to **$107K (YTD)**

- **Interpretation:**  
  A significant year-over-year drop of **~18% in revenue** and **~20% in profit** shows a downward trend continuing into Q3.

- **Impact:**  
  Ongoing decline suggests broader issues such as declining demand, pricing pressure, or strategic misalignment.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Conduct a comprehensive business review. Focus on stabilizing key segments, optimizing pricing and promotions, and re-aligning resources to high-performing areas identified in earlier quarters.

### Key Insight: Treadmill Revenue Trend (2024)

#### Chart Referenced  
Clustered Bar Chart – Top 10 Products by Revenue (Q1, Q2, Q3 2024)

---

#### Observation  
Treadmill leads the top 10 products with revenues of **$5.2K in Q1**, **$6.0K in Q2**, followed by a notable decline to **$3.58K in Q3**.

---

#### Interpretation  
Sales showed growth between Q1 and Q2 but dropped significantly in Q3, which may indicate seasonal demand fluctuations, supply chain challenges, or increased competition.

---

#### Impact  
This decline could negatively affect overall quarterly revenue and profitability, given Treadmill’s position as the highest-revenue product.

---

#### Recommendation  
Perform an in-depth analysis of Q3 sales drivers—review marketing campaigns, inventory management, and competitor activities. Implement targeted promotions or product bundling to boost Q3 sales and smooth revenue across the year.

### Key Insight: Profit by Product Category (Q1–Q3 2024)

#### Chart Referenced  
Clustered Bar Chart – Profit by Product Category (Electronics, Sports, Clothing, Beauty, Home Goods) for Q1 to Q3 2024

---

#### Observation  
- Electronics leads in profit for **Q1** with **$17,389**.  
- Electronics profit declines to **$9,867** in **Q2**.  
- In **Q3**, Sports becomes the top profit category with **$7,152**, surpassing Electronics.

---

#### Interpretation  
Electronics shows strong early performance but experiences a significant profit decrease by mid-year, while Sports gains momentum and overtakes Electronics in Q3. This shift may indicate changing consumer demand or successful marketing initiatives in Sports.

---

#### Impact  
Sustained profit decline in Electronics could affect overall margins, while Sports’ growth represents an opportunity to increase profitability in a rising category.

---

#### Recommendation  
- Analyze factors causing Electronics’ profit drop, such as pricing or costs.  
- Invest in expanding Sports category promotions and product development.  
- Rebalance marketing and resource allocation toward high-performing categories to maximize profit growth.

#### Chart Referenced  
Matrix Chart – Sales by Region and Sales Channels across Q1, Q2, and Q3 2024

---

#### Observation  
- **Q1 Highlights:**
  - South America (Online Direct) leads with **9,910**
  - Africa (Offline) = **4,716**
  - Asia (Retail) = **2,926**
  - Europe (Online Direct) = **3,295**
  - North America (Channel unspecified) = **2,166**

- **Q2 Highlights:**
  - Asia (Offline) = **4,127**
  - South America (Offline) = **3,974**
  - Europe (Offline) = **2,775**
  - Africa (Offline) = **1,873**
  - North America (Retail) = **1,369**

- **Q3 Highlights:**
  - Europe (Retail) = **4,120**
  - Africa (Offline) = **2,191**
  - South America (Online Direct) = **2,636**
  - Asia (Online Direct) = **1,139**
  - North America (Wholesale) = **1,690**

---

#### Interpretation  
- In **Q1**, South America dominates through **Online Direct**, while Africa performs well through **Offline** channels.  
- **Q2** sees a pivot to **Offline sales**, with Asia and South America leading via this channel.  
- By **Q3**, Europe emerges on top with **Retail** sales, while Online Direct in South America declines compared to Q1.

These trends suggest changing customer preferences and possibly seasonal or campaign-driven channel performance.

---

####  Impact  
Fluctuations in channel effectiveness across regions can impact supply chain planning, channel investments, and regional strategies. Relying heavily on a single channel in one region may also pose risks if customer behavior shifts unexpectedly.

---

#### Recommendations:  
- **Capitalize on high-performing channel-region pairs**, such as Retail in Europe (Q3) and Online Direct in South America (Q1).  
- **Diversify channel strategies** in regions like North America, where performance is lower and fragmented.  
- **Monitor declining segments**, like Online Direct in South America from Q1 to Q3, for potential recovery actions or channel repositioning.  
- **Align marketing and logistics** strategies with quarterly channel trends to optimize efficiency and responsiveness.

- **March:** Profit: **$15,893** | Revenue: **$20,990**  
- **May:** Profit: **$19,049** | Revenue: **$23,672**  
- **July:** Profit: **$19,134** | Revenue: **$25,174**

- **July:** Profit: **$15,694** | Revenue: **$21,327**  
- **August:** Profit: **$10,554** | Revenue: **$13,769**

---

#### Interpretation  
- **2023:** Steady revenue and profit growth through May and July, followed by a **decline in profit** in Q4 (October to December) despite stable revenue—indicating **shrinking profit margins**.
- **2024 March:** Both profit and revenue improved over March 2023, showing **positive YoY growth**.
- **2024 July–August:** Sharp decline in both revenue and profit compared to July 2023, with **August showing the lowest performance** in the entire dataset.

---

#### Impact  
- Q4 2023 and mid-2024 figures suggest **margin compression and revenue slowdown**.  
- If the declining trend continues, it could undermine profitability targets for 2024 and strain operating efficiency.

---

#### Recommendation  
- **Investigate Q4 2023 and mid-2024 profitability decline**—review cost drivers, pricing strategy, or underperforming segments.  
- **Leverage strong months (e.g., March 2024)** to identify successful tactics worth replicating.  
- Implement tighter cost control or promotional adjustments during weaker months (July–August).  
- Forecast cash flow conservatively for the remainder of 2024 and consider revising quarterly targets.

#### Chart Referenced  
Clustered Bar Chart – Revenue by Customer Segment Comparison (2023 vs 2024)

---

#### Observation  

**2023 Revenue by Segment:**  
- Wholesale: **$70,241**  
- Retail: **$67,050**  
- Online Direct: **$22,696**  
- High-Income Customers: **$5,550**

**2024 Revenue by Segment:**  
- Wholesale: **$36,850**  
- Retail: **$44,378**  
- Online Direct: **$34,036**  
- Subscription: **$13,410** *(new segment)*  
- Premium Customers: **$3,510** *(new segment)*

---

#### Interpretation  
- **Wholesale and Retail** revenues have declined significantly in 2024.  
- **Online Direct** saw substantial growth, increasing from **$22.7K to $34K** (~50%).  
- **New segments**—**Subscription** and **Premium Customers**—have been introduced, contributing a combined **$16.9K** in revenue.

---

#### Impact  
The decline in core B2B and retail channels may signal **reduced bulk demand** or changing consumer purchasing patterns. However, growth in **Online Direct** and new segments reflects a **shift toward digital and recurring revenue models**.

---

#### Recommendation  
- **Double down on Online Direct and Subscription** segments—optimize user experience, offers, and engagement strategies.  
- **Reassess Wholesale and Retail strategies**—explore pricing models, partner relationships, or shifting demand.  
- Consider **expanding Premium and Subscription tiers**, leveraging higher-margin opportunities for long-term growth.  
- Use segment-level insights to align marketing, product bundling, and channel investments.

| 2024 | CUST1021    | 3,126       |

---

#### Interpretation  
- In 2023, **CUST1091** was the top customer with **$9,275**, followed by several high-value customers above **$5K**.  
- In 2024, the top customer **CUST1048** generated **$5,510**, indicating a **decline in high-value customer revenue**.  
- Only **CUST1061** appears in both years, though their contribution dropped from **$4,805** to **$3,533**.

---

#### Impact  
There is a noticeable **drop in top customer revenue in 2024**, with fewer customers crossing the $5K mark. This could suggest **customer churn**, **reduced order sizes**, or a shift in account focus.

---

#### Recommendation  
- Conduct a **customer retention and segmentation analysis**—target prior top performers like CUST1091 and CUST1015 for re-engagement campaigns.  
- **Identify reasons behind the drop in recurring high-value clients** (pricing, competition, service issues).  
- **Nurture current top spenders (2024)** with loyalty programs, tailored offers, or account-based strategies to grow their lifetime value.

| 10   | REP02      | 7,000       |

---

#### Interpretation  
- In **2023**, top performers like **REP09** and **REP06** generated **$26K+**, indicating strong individual contribution.  
- In **2024**, revenue per rep **declined across the board**, with no rep exceeding **$16K**.  
- Several reps—**REP09, REP06, REP10, REP03, REP07**—remained in the top group but at significantly lower levels.

---

#### Impact  
This indicates a **broad decline in sales rep productivity or deal value**, possibly due to market conditions, changes in compensation, or fewer opportunities. This could directly affect total revenue and quarterly targets.

---

#### Recommendation  
- **Investigate the root cause** of declining rep performance—evaluate quota changes, lead quality, and external conditions.  
- Provide **performance coaching or incentive restructuring** for key reps to help regain momentum.  
- Consider **reallocating leads** based on historical rep performance and strengthening support for mid-tier reps who showed potential in 2023.  
- Use funnel visuals in performance reviews to identify drop-off points and guide focused sales enablement strategies.
